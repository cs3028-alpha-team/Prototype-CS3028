# CS3208 Team Alpha - Skillbridge

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Skillbridge, an automated internship match-making software commissioned to Team Alpha by the university's school of medicine, medical sciences and nutrition.
In this document you will find a broad explanation of what the application does and how to run it on your own machine, if you so wish.
A video demostration of the application in action can be found [here](https://clipchamp.com/watch/ZN3sJKAj60H).

#### Running the Application

In order to run the application you will need to have the following softwares installed and set-up on your computer :

1. MySQL Workbench
2. Python 3.1 or above, Python TkInter
3. An IDE (i.e. Visual Studio Code)

Once the above technologies are configured, you will need to tailor the variables in **config.py** to your computer. An example can be found below 
</br>
![config-example](https://github.com/cs3028-alpha-team/career-portal-development/assets/98479421/21285687-d182-4b52-97d7-18c0e7e55619)

Once your development environment has been configured, travel to the project folder and run the command **python main.py** from your terminal of choice.
The Home window will appear on your screen, where you can toggle a checkbox to display the algorithm outputs to screen and run the following actions :

1. Click the **Run match** button to match the current datasets of students and internships, you will see the outputs written to **matches.csv** in the outputs folder.
2. Click the **Settings** button to access the settings dashboard, where you can toggle the fields you would like to the algorithm to use during the matching process and assign a
   priority score to each criteria selected. Please note that you can assign multiple criteria the same priority, if you so wish

Open the **matches.csv** file, where you will find the matches generated by the algorithm. A match will be displayed with the format *match quality*, *student* -> *internship*.
Here is an example from running the default algorithm
